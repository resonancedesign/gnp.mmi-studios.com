    <h3>Bio
    	<small class="tag-line"><br>'The unfiltered creation through the destruction of preset notions of what should and shouldn't be.'</small>
    </h3>
    <p>Gross National Produkt (GNP) was born on the sun-scorched shores of Tampa, Florida from the unholy union of Riki Rezinunts and Martin Davis as an electro-industrial project back in 1997. What started off as a nameless yet definitive idea shared by the pair soon became the mission statement of the act: a desire to create electronic industrial music that always seeks to fuse itself with new elements, creating a constantly changing hybrid which strives to make each new track somewhat of a departure from the previous while still maintaining a signature sound paying homage to the roots of electro-industrial music. Though Martin was forced to leave GNP shortly after the project came kicking and screaming into the world, Riki was not discouraged from keeping it alive and further nurturing its development.</p>
	<p>Since its formative years in the late 90s, GNP has given birth to six children of its own in the form of five full-length LPs and one EP and has also spread its dark seed throughout several compilations; the most recent being the Front Line Assembly tribute album "Replicate 02" on MoMT records in December of 2010.</p>
	<p>Recently, GNP has been taking a time-out while Riki focuses his attention on developing other music projects as well as pursuing entirely new artistic ventures, but GNP is far from aborted.</p>
	<p>The upstart project is not yet done with the world as four new releases are planned. Just recently released as of July 4th of 2011 is the long overdue full-length, "Intensities : Sonics : Extremes", an aggressive and stark collection of nihilistic machine anthems for the apocalyptic dance-floor. Before the next full-length of new material leaves a bloody trail in clubs the world over, GNP plans to unleash â€œProgressions In Produktion", a retrospective of the best of the projects unreleased progeny, as well as a retrospective of covers and remixes called "Re:Produktion". Work on the next full length GNP album is in full swing, and for the first time since 1998, will feature a new band-mate: long-time contributor and collaborator, Jamason Finn from the experimental project CEO.</p>
